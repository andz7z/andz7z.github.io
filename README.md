## 🪄 About the Project

**ANDZ** is my personal portfolio — a project that blends **design**, **animation**, and **interactivity** into a single web experience.  
It showcases my **skills**, **projects**, **services**, and a **fully functional reviews system**, all wrapped in a **modern cinematic design**.

> ⚡ Powered by pure JavaScript and Firebase for real-time dynamic content.

## 🧭 Website Structure

### 🏠 **Home**

- **Video-loop background** for cinematic experience  
- 4 floating navigation buttons:  
  - **Service**  
  - **My Work**  
  - **Contact Me**  
  - **Reviews**

> 🪶 When you scroll, these 4 buttons appear at the bottom for easy navigation.
